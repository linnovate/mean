# MEAN.io

MEAN is a framework that provides a easy starting point for [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) based applications. It is designed to give you a quick and organized way to start developing MEAN based web apps with useful modules like Mongoose and Passport pre-bundled and configured. We mainly try to take care of the connection points between existing popular frameworks and solve common integration problems.
## Prerequisites
* *MongoDB* - <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/downloads">Download</a> and Install mongodb - <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual">Checkout their manual</a> if you're just starting.
* *Node.js* - <a href="http://nodejs.org/download/">Download</a> and I×žstall Node.js, codeschool has free <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/real-time-web-with-node-js">node</a> and <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js">angular</a> tutorials.
* *Git* - Get git using a package manager or <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">download</a> it.
* *Grunt* - Download and install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com).

```
$ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```
* *Bower* - Dowload and install [Bower](http://bower.io/).

```
$ sudo npm install -g bower
```

## Installation
To start with MEAN install the `mean-cli` package from NPM.
This will add the *mean* command which lets you interact (install, manage, update ...) your mean based  application.

### Install the MEAN CLI

```bash
  $ sudo npm install -g mean-cli
```
From your web server's root directory, excute the following commands:

```
  $ sudo mean init <myApp>
  $ cd <myApp> && sudo npm install && sudo bower install --allow-root
```

### Invoke node with Grunt
We recommend using [Grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) to start the server:
```bash
  $ grunt
```
If grunt aborts because of JSHINT errors, these can be overridden with the `force` flag:
```bash
  $ grunt -f
```
Alternatively, when not using `grunt` (and for production environments) you can run:
```bash
  $ node server
```
Then, open a browser and go to:
```bash
  http://localhost:3000
```
### Troubleshooting
During installation depending on your os and prerequiste versions you may encounter some issues.

Most issues can be solved by one of the following tips, but if are unable to find a solution feel free to contact us via the repository issue tracker or the links provided below.

#### Update NPM, Bower or Grunt
Sometimes you may find there is a weird error during install like npm's *Error: ENOENT*. Usually updating those tools to the latest version solves the issue.

* Updating NPM:
```bash
$ npm update -g npm
```
* Updating Grunt:
```bash
$ npm update -g grunt-cli
```

* Updating Bower:
```
$ npm update -g bower
```

#### Cleaning NPM and Bower cache
NPM and Bower has a caching system for holding packages that you already installed.
We found that often cleaning the cache solves some troubles this system creates.

* NPM Clean Cache:
```bash
$ npm cache clean
```

* Bower Clean Cache:
```bash
$ bower cache clean
```

#### Installation problems on Windows 8 / 8.1
Some of Mean.io dependencies uses [node-gyp](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp) with supported Python version 2.7.x. So if you see an error related to node-gyp rebuild follow next steps:

1. install [Python 2.7.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. install [Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2012 Express](http://www.microsoft.com/ru-ru/download/details.aspx?id=34673)
3. Run NPM update
```bash
$ npm update -g
```

## CLI
### Overview

The MEAN CLI is a simple Command Line Interface for installing and managing MEAN applications. As a core module of the mean.io project, it provides a number of useful tools to make interaction with your MEAN application easier, with features such as: scaffolding, module creation and admin, status checks, and user management.
```bash
  $ mean
  $ mean --help
  $ mean help
```
  <code>mean help</code> can also be used in conjunction with any command to get more information about that particular functionality. For example, try <code>mean help init</code> to see the options for init
```bash
  $ mean help [command]
```
### Users

 <p>Information can be display for a specific customer via <code>mean user email</code>. Email is required. User roles can be assigned or removed with the <code>--addRole (or -a)</code> and <code>--removeRole (or -r)</code> options, respectively.
  <p>For example, the <i>admin</i> role is required to edit tokens.</p>
```bash
  $ mean user <email>
  $ mean user <email> --addRole <role>;
  $ mean user <email> --removeRole <role>;
```

### packages
#### Management
 <p class="alert alert-warning">All of the remaining of the commands must be run from the root folder of your MEAN application.</p>
  <p>Contributed MEAN packages can be installed or uninstalled via the CLI. Also, currently installed modules can be viewed with the <code>list</code> command.</p>
```bash
  $ mean list
  $ mean install &lt;module&gt;
  $ mean uninstall &lt;module&gt;
```

  <p class="alert alert-info">Mean packages installed via the installer are found in <i>/node_modules</i></p>
#### Search
To find new packages run the *mean search* command
```bash
  $ mean search [packagename]
```
mean search will return all of the available packages, mean search packagename will filter the search results.

#### Scaffolding
To create a new MEAN app, run <code>mean init</code>. Name for the application is optional. If no name is provided, "mean" is used. The MEAN project will be cloned from GitHub into a directory of the application name.
```bash
  $ mean init [name]
  $ cd [name] &amp;&amp; npm install
```
  <p class="alert alert-info">Note: <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">git</a> must be installed for this command to work properly.</p>

### Misc
<h4>Status</h4>
<p>Check the database connection for a particular environment (e.g. development (default), test, production) and make sure that the meanio command line version is up to date.</p>
```bash
  $ mean status
```
<h4>Docs</h4>
<p>A simple shortcut to open the mean documentation in your default browser.</p>
```bash
  $ mean docs
```

## Packages
Everything in mean.io is a package and when extending mean with custom functionality make sure you create your own package and do not alter the core packages.

```
This will create a package under */packages/custom/pkgName*
### Contributing you package
### Config
All the configuration is specified in the [config](/config/) folder,
through the [env](config/env/) files, and is orchestrated through the [meanio](https://github.com/linnovate/meanio) NPM module.
Here you will need to specify your application name, database name, and hook up any social app keys if you want integration with Twitter, Facebook, GitHub, or Google.

### Environmental Settings

There is a shared environment config: __all__

* __root__ - This the default root path for the application.
* __port__ - DEPRECATED to __http.port__ or __https.port__.
* __http.port__ - This sets the default application port.
* __https__ - These settings are for running HTTPS / SSL for a secure application.
* __port__ - This sets the default application port for HTTPS / SSL. If HTTPS is not used then is value is to be set to __false__ which is the default setting. If HTTPS is to be used the standard HTTPS port is __443__.
* __ssl.key__ - The path to public key.
* __ssl.cert__ - The path to certificate.

There are three environments provided by default: __development__, __test__, and __production__.
Each of these environments has the following configuration options:

* __db__ - This is where you specify the MongoDB / Mongoose settings
* __url__ - This is the url/name of the MongoDB database to use, and is set by default to __mean-dev__ for the development environment.
* __debug__ - Setting this option to __true__ will log the output all Mongoose executed collection methods to your console.  The default is set to __true__ for the development environment.
* __options__ - These are the database options that will be passed directly to mongoose.connect in the __production__ environment: [server, replset, user, pass, auth, mongos] (http://mongoosejs.com/docs/connections.html#options) or read [this] (http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/driver-articles/mongoclient.html#mongoclient-connect-options) for more information.
* __app.name__ - This is the name of your app or website, and can be different for each environment. You can tell which environment you are running by looking at the TITLE attribute that your app generates.
* __Social OAuth Keys__ - Facebook, GitHub, Google, Twitter. You can specify your own social application keys here for each platform:
  * __clientID__
  * __clientSecret__
  * __callbackURL__
* __emailFrom__ - This is the from email address displayed when sending an email.
* __mailer__ - This is where you enter your email service provider, username and password.

To run with a different environment, just specify NODE_ENV as you call grunt:
```bash
    $ NODE_ENV=test grunt
```
If you are using node instead of grunt, it is very similar:
```bash
    $ NODE_ENV=test node server
```
To simply run tests
```bash
    $ npm test
```
> NOTE: Running Node.js applications in the __production__ environment enables caching, which is disabled by default in all other environments.

## Staying up to date
After initializing a project, you'll see that the root directory of your project is already a git repository. MEAN uses git to download and update its own code. To handle its own operations, MEAN creates a remote called `upstream`. This way you can use git as you would in any other project.

To maintain your own public or private repository, add your repository as remote. See here for information on [adding an existing project to GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line).

```bash
git remote add origin <remote repository URL>
git push -u origin master
```


## Hosting MEAN

### Heroku
Before you start make sure you have the [Heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)
installed and an accessible MongoDB instance - you can try [MongoHQ](http://www.mongohq.com/)
which has an easy setup).

Add the db string to the production env in server/config/env/production.js.

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial version"
heroku apps:create
heroku config:add NODE_ENV=production
heroku config:add BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/mbuchetics/heroku-buildpack-nodejs-grunt.git
git push heroku master
heroku config:set NODE_ENV=production
```

### OpenShift

1. Register for an account on Openshift (http://www.openshift.com).
1. Create an app on Openshift by choosing a 'Node' type site to create. Create the site by making Openshift use Linnovate's Openshift git repo as its source code (https://github.com/linnovate/mean-on-openshift.git)
1. On the second screen after the new application has been created, add a Mongo database
1. When the site has been built, you can visit it on your newly created domain, which will look like my-domain.openshift.com. You may need to restart the instance on Openshift before you can see it. It will look like Mean.io boilerplate.
1. On your new app's console page on Openshift, make a note of the git repo where the code lives. Clone that repo to your local computer where your mean.io app codebase is.
1. Merge your completed local app into this new repo. You will have some conflicts, so merge carefully, line by line.
1. Commit and push the repo with the Openshift code back up to Openshift. Restart your instance on Openshift, you should see your site!
