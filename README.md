# MEAN Stack

MEAN is a boilerplate that provides a nice starting point for MongoDB, Node.js, Express, and AngularJS based applications.  
It is designed to give you quick and organized way to start developing of MEAN based web apps with useful modules like mongoose and passport pre-bundled and configured.  
We mainly try to take care of the connection points between existing popular frameworks and solve common integration problems.  

## Prerequisites
* Node.js - Download and Install [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/).
* MongoDB - Download and Install [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) - Make sure it's running on the default port(27017).

## MEAN Modules
* Mean presents a growing eco-system of MEAN based modules in the npm repository, To write (and contribute) your own MEAN based module checkout [mean-logger](https://npmjs.org/package/mean-logger) for examples.


## Additional Packages
* Express - Defined as npm module in the [Package.json](package.json) file.
* Mongoose - Defined as npm module in the [Package.json](package.json) file.
* Passport - Defined as npm module in the [Package.json](package.json) file.
* AngularJS - Pre-bundled in the [public](public/) folder.
* Twitter Bootstrap - Pre-bundled in the [public](public/) folder.

## Configuration
See the [config](config/) folder and especially the [config.js](config/config.js) file.

## Quick Start

 The quickest way to get started with MEAN is to clone the project and utilize it like this:

 Install dependencies:

    $ npm install

 Start the server:

    $ node server
 
 Then open a browser and go to 
    
    $ http://localhost:3000
    
## The Future
  We are currently working on a extendable module system to make it more like a framework with support for modern web development requirements.
